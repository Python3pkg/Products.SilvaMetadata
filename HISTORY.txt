   0.7.2

     Bugs fixed

   0.7.1

     Features added

       - Added Infrae standard release documentation.

     Bugs fixed

       - Avoid quadratic behavior while indexing. Previously, for n
         elements that are indexed, for each element indexing the data
         for the n indexes was accessed, resulting in quadratic
         behavior while indexing (n * n values were accessed per
         object).

   0.5
