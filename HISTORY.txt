    0.13

      Features added

        - MetadataTool.getMetadataValue can now get just this objects
          metadata, not acquiring parent metadata

    0.11

      Features added

        - If an extension to Silva provides IAcquiredUpdater adapters for
          content objects, these will used. An IAcquiredUpdater adapter for
          an IContainer could for instance reindex any sub-objects.

        - Use Zope 3 style interfaces. This means that Zope 2.8 is now
          required.

      Bugs fixed

        - Stop using deprecated CMFCore.CMFCorePermissions module
 
        - Even more fixes to the unit tests (issue 1381).

    0.10

      Bugs fixed

        - Fixed unit tests (issue 1380).

    0.9

      Features added

        - Metadata sets can have a 'category' property. This property can
          be used to define special purpose metadata sets.

        - The minimal_role and category properties are exported and
          imported to/from the XML metadata set definitions.

      Bugs fixed

        - setValuesFromRequest now uses Formulator to validate user input.
          This solves the infamous 'checkbox' problem.

        - MetadataTool.setMetadataValues() has been removed.

        - XML export/import now works with latest Formulator release
          (fixing issues with Formulator's i18n support).

        - unit test have been updated to run with Silva

        - MetadataTool.getMetadataValue now supports object delegation.

    0.8

      Features added

        - Metadata Sets now have a Minimal Role property, that can be used
          by Silva to restrict access to a Set.

    0.7.6
  
      Bugs fixed

        - Make getMetadataValue shortcut a bit more robust. Also some
          performance tweaks.

    0.7.5

      Bugs fixed

        - XML import with unrecognized metadata sets now skips these sets
          silently.

        - XML export for integers and floats should now work properly when
          Python 2.1 is used.

        - Make SilvaMetadata field editing work with Formulator 1.6.0.

    0.7.4 

      Bugs fixed

        - XML import would fail with a NameError if a metadata set is
          imported that is not registered. Now it fails with a more
          informative error... What *should* be happening is that this
          unrecognized metadata is skipped, instead.

    0.7.3

      Features added

        - icon for service_metadata.

      Bugs fixed

        - XML import of complex lists for items now works.

        - Indexing with XML import now works.
       
    0.7.2

      Bugs fixed

        - getMetadataValue was buggy and didn't really work. Fixed.

    0.7.1

      Features added

        - Added Infrae standard release documentation.

      Bugs fixed

        - Avoid quadratic behavior while indexing. Previously, for n
          elements that are indexed, for each element indexing the data for
          the n indexes was accessed, resulting in quadratic behavior while
          indexing (n * n values were accessed per object).

    0.5

      Initial public release of SilvaMetadata.
