  Design

    Storage/Annotations
     
      metadata storage is based on annotating content objects. metadata
      storage itself is partioned by set namespaces, and also includes
      a partition for metadata configuration on a per object basis.

    Definitions
    
      definitions of the metadata are conducted with the metadata tool zmi
      interface. these definitions are managed as sets composed of elements,
      with guards and fields attached to elements. these definitions can
      be exported and imported to xml and are used for validation and display
      of the metadata. these definitions are then mapped onto content types
      that they will be available for.

    Tool API 

      the metadata tool api is fairly simple, the core of it is simply
      one method. getMetadata which returns a binding object, below.

      the additional methods are present to conform to the metadata tool
      api defined by the cmf interfaces.

    Binding/Adapter

      bindings functions as an adapter between the content object,
      the metadata definition, and the stored metdata values. it offers
      a unified api to the programmer to operate on an object's metadata,
      and unlike a service or tool, allows for security checks to be 
      automatically performed in the context of the content object.

      additionally the binding adapter makes use of the metadata storage
      to store configuration options that can be set per object, that 
      affect the runtime behavior of the binding. this capability is used
      to implement some of the advanced features of the metadata system
      such as metadata acquisition and mutation triggers, and can be
      extended as need arises.

    Indexing and Searching
    
      because metadata is stored in an object annotation, and accessed
      through a binding object, direct indexing of an object's metadata
      using the normal zcatalog indexes is not possible. The
      ProxyIndex product was developed to address the issue, and
      allows for the use of a tales expression to retrieve values for
      indexing. the metadata system automatically constructs indexes
      for a metadata set upon set initialization, using tales
      expressions to retrieve a binding and an element's value for
      a content object.
 
    Hook Points

      To allow for flexibility and customization based on a
      requirements the metadata system offers two major hook points
      exposed at by its python api.

      Access 

        The Access hook is used by the metadata tool to construct
	a binding for a content object. access hooks can be registered
	on a per content type basis or as a default hook.

      Runtime Data Initializer

        When a metadata binding is constructed for an object with no
	metadata annotation data, a runtime data initializer is
	invoked to construct the binding's runtime data. initializers
	can be defined on a per content type basis or as a default 
	initializer.

  Installation

    Dependencies

      - Formulator 1.4+ 

      - Annotations 0.4.0

      - ProxyIndex-1.0.0

    CMF Installation

      requires CMF 1.3+ (compatible with CMF1.4)

      add an external method install_metadata::
   
       Module: CMFMetadata.Install
       Function: install_all
   
      the install all, also installs the annotation
      product. if its already installed, you can use 
      function install instead.

    Silva Installation

      the metadata system comes bundled silva 0.9.2 and is
      installed as part of a silva installation.
