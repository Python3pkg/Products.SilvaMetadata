  Zope. See the instructions below on how to integrate it with Silva
  or the CMF.

Silva Installation

  The metadata system comes bundled with Silva 0.9.2 and is installed as
  part of a Silva installation.

CMF Installation

  Requires CMF 1.3+ (compatible with CMF 1.4)

    Add an external method install_metadata::

       Module: CMFMetadata.Install
       Function: install_all

    'install_all' also installs the Annotations product. If its
    already installed, you can use the function 'install' instead.
