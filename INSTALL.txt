Installing SilvaMetadata

  First make sure all requirements (see below) are installed. Then
  install SilvaMetadata in Zope's 'Products' directory and restart
  Zope. See the instructions below on how to integrate it with Silva
  or the CMF.

SilvaMetadata Requirements

  Formulator (1.5.0+)

  Annotations (0.4.3+)

  ProxyIndex (1.2)

  All these can be found on http://www.infrae.com/download

Silva Installation

  The metadata system comes bundled with Silva and is installed as
  part of a Silva installation.

CMF Installation

  Requires CMF 1.3+ (compatible with CMF 1.4)

    Add an external method install_metadata::

       Module: CMFMetadata.Install
       Function: install_all

    'install_all' also installs the Annotations product. If its
    already installed, you can use the function 'install' instead.
