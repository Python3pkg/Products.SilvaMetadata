Silva Metadata
==============

Silva Metadata provides a tool to define generic metadata set for
Silva content types. Metadata are defined in a service,
``service_metadata``, and metadata values edited on the content type.

Metadata can be optionaly indexed into the Zope catalog, and imported
and exported as XML. Metadata definitions can be too imported and
exported as XML files.

You can find more information on how to use the metadata system in the
`Silva developer documentation`_.
